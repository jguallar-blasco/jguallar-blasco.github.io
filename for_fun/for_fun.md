*On my most recent trip home to Spain I had to opportunity to visit Barcelona. While there I stumbled upon a seed stand in Las Ramblas where I found the seeds for the Dracaena draco. This is an evergreen subtropical tree native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde and Morroco. This picture shows about 4 months of growth.*

*I acquired this Monstera delciosa, commonly known as the Swiss Cheese plant, 4 years ago when it was about 10 inches tall. This plant is native to Mexico and Panama and produces a delicious edible fruit (hence the name "deliciosa"). I have changed this plant's pot 4 times and it is now in a 12 gallon pot. Can you see the bird in the picture?*

*I acquired this Monstera delciosa, commonly known as the Swiss Cheese plant, 4 years ago when it was about 10 inches tall. This plant is native to Mexico and Panana and produces a delicious edible fruit (hence the name "deliciosa"). I have changed this plant's pot 4 times and it is now in a 12 gallon pot. Can you see the bird in the picture?

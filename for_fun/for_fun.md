*Often planted as decoration and security due to its pretty white flowers but sharp thorns, the Asian trifoliate orange (Citrus trifoliata) is bush invasie to the East Coast. Please avoid planting, remove when possible, and attempt to discard any fallen orange from this tree to avoid further propagation.*

*My most recent trip home to Spain I had to opportunity to visit Barcelona. While there I stumbled upon a seed stand in Las Ramblas where I found the seeds for the Dracaena draco. This is an evergreen subtropical tree native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde and Morroco. This picture shows about 4 months of growth.*

*This is my my Adenium obesum, also known as the desert rose. Until recently, this plant had been on my plants-to-get list for over 3 years. Native to the Shel region of the Sahara and the Arabian Peninsula, this an a flowering evergreen requiring very little water. Although this plant is extremely slow growing, it can reach 10 feet in height when fully mature.*

*I acquired this Monstera delciosa, commonly known as the Swiss Cheese plant, 4 years ago when it was about 10 inches tall. This plant is native to Mexico and Panama and produces a delicious edible fruit (hence the name "deliciosa"). I have changed this plant's pot 4 times and it is now in a 12 gallon pot. Can you see the bird in the picture?*

<h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

Jimena is a Research Associate at the Johns Hopkins University Human Language Technology Center of Excellence. She recently graduated from the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering with a Bachelors of Science and a Master of Science in Engeering in Computer Science (with a concentration in Natural Language Processing). Before her current positions, we was a research assistant at the JHU Center for Language and Speech Processing, where she was advised by Benjamin Van Durme. Her primary research interests are natural language processing and computational semantics, in semantically complex multimodal settings.

<h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

I am Research Associate at the Johns Hopkins University Human Language Technology Center of Excellence. I recently graduated from the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering with a Bachelors and Mater's degree in Computer Science (with a concentration in Natural Language Processing). I am also a research assistant at the JHU Center for Language and Speech Processing, advised by Benjamin Van Durme My primary research interests are computational semantics and question answering, especially in ambigous and multi-modal settings.

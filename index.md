<h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

I am an undergraduate at [Johns Hopkins](https://www.jhu.edu) studying Physics and Mathematics, with a strong minor in Earth & Planetary Science. I work with [Professor Nadia Zakamska](https://zakamska.johnshopkins.edu) and [Vedant Chandra](https://vedantchandra.com) studying the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs in wide binaries with main sequence stars.

Previously I worked on the [CLASS Telescope](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/) under Professor Toby Marriage, characterizing aerogel scattering filters in collaboration with [Tom Essinger-Hileman](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/thomas.m.essinger-hileman) at NASA Goddard.

Currently, I'm studying white dwarfs in wide binaries with main sequence stars, but I'm interested in a wide variety of things from a wide variety of fields. More information on my current and past research can be found on my [research page](https://stefanarseneau.github.io/research).

<h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

I am combined master/undergraduate student at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Whiting School of Engineering studying computer science with a concentration in Natural Language Processing. I am also a student researcher at the JHU Center for Language and Speech Processing, advised by Benjamin Van Durme, and at the JHU Political Science Department, advised by Nicolas Jabko. My primary research interests are computational semantics and question answering, especially in ambigous and multi-modal settings.

<h1 id="research">Current Research</h1>

I have recently been working on several projects at the JHU CLSP and at the JHU Department of Political Science. At the CLSP I am working on computationally oriented analysis of why-question ambiguity as well as a video oriented question-answering dataset. In the Political Science Depermant, I am developing a method to determine and extract moments of contention from political documents.

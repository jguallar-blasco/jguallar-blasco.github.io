      										<h1>The Mass-Radius Relation of White Dwarfs</h1>
<h3>What is the Mass-Radius Relation?</h3>
<p>White dwarf stars represent the final stage of evolution of the vast majority of stars in our galaxy. Generally, stars generate energy by undergoing nuclear fusion of elements such as hydrogen that are abundant in their core. This creates energy in the form of radiation pressure that allows them to counteract the force of gravity which acts to compress them in on themselves, and allows the star to remain stable, undergoing nuclear fusion while maintaining a certain radius. As they age, however, they run out of fuel until eventually they can no longer maintain the nuclear fusion reaction and they collapse in on themselves under the force of gravity. All stars under a certain mass, estimated at 6-8 times the mass of the Sun, come out of this process as white dwarfs: extremely compact stars whose gravity is balanced by electron degeneracy pressure, with mass similar to that of the Sun and radius comparable to that of the Earth.</p>

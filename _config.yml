description: I am a student at the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering. My major is computer science with a concentration in natural language processing. I work at the Center for Language and Speech Processing where my advisor is Benjamin Van Durme. Additionally, I am a natural language processing research assistant at the Johns Hopkins Department of Political Science under Nicolas Jabko. My primary research interests are semantic parsing and question answering, especially in multi-modal and political settings.

I"1 <h1>The Mass-Radius Relation of White Dwarfs</h1>
<h3>What is the Mass-Radius Relation?</h3>
<p>White dwarf stars represent the final stage of evolution of the vast majority of stars in our galaxy. Generally, stars generate energy by undergoing nuclear fusion of elements such as hydrogen that are abundant in their core. This creates energy in the form of radiation pressure that allows them to counteract the force of gravity which acts to compress them in on themselves, and allows the star to remain stable, undergoing nuclear fusion while maintaining a certain radius. As they age, however, they run out of fuel until eventually they can no longer maintain the nuclear fusion reaction and they collapse in on themselves under the force of gravity. All stars under a certain mass, estimated at $6-8$ times the mass of the Sun, come out of this process as white dwarfs: extremely compact stars whose gravity is balanced by electron degeneracy pressure, with mass similar to that of the Sun and radius comparable to that of the Earth.</p>

<p>The material in the core of a white dwarf is in fact so dense that rather than being composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, their cores are composed of a plasma of unbound electrons and nucleii which exert pressure (called “electron degeneracy pressure”) to balance the force of gravity. On account of their density, white dwarfs exhibit unique quantum mechanical properties at a macroscopic scale. One such phenomenon is their unique mass-radius relation. In an ordinary (so called “main sequence”) star, where thermal pressure created by fusion balances the force of gravity, an increase in mass provides an increase in the amount of fuel available to undergo fusion, and hence leads to a larger radius. Because white dwarfs do not undergo fusion, if a white dwarf increases in mass, the only effect is to increase the strength of gravity on the star. This means that unlike other stars, as white dwarfs increase in mass, they decrease in radius. The central hypothesis of my project is that in the case of white dwarfs, mass and radius go as the theoretical relation described by Chandrasekhar in 1933. I am testing this theoretical relation, by more than doubling the current number of direct measurements of the mass-radius relation of individual white dwarfs.</p>

<h3>Why do we care?</h3>

<p>Past measurements of the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aba8a2">mass radius relation using gravitational redshift</a> have been statistical in nature, combining the radial velocities of a very large sample to statistically remove the random radial velocity signal. Likewise, <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/07/aa35835-19/aa35835-19.html">measurement have been made of the mass radius relation of individual stars</a>, but never using this technique, and never at the scale that I expect to achieve.</p>

<p>Creating a large sample of white dwarfs whose mass radius relation is known allows for further astrophysical analysis to be performed. For example, it is predicted that very hot white dwarfs should have greater radius at the same mass (that is, they should be puffier), and hence they follow along a more shallow curve than cooler white dwarfs. This is because hotter white dwarfs are predicted to experience a greater contribution to electron degeneracy pressure to counteract the compressing force of gravity better than their cooler counterparts. In order to verify this effect, measurements of the mass-radius relation of individual white dwarfs are needed. This is because surface temperature is widely distributed across the population of white dwarfs, and thus the process of averaging out radial velocity has the side effect of averaging out temperature deviations that may have been present in the sample.</p>

<p>Likewise, open questions remain in stellar astrophysics as to the core composition of white dwarfs. White dwarfs with different core compositions are predicted to also have different radii at a given mass. Although difficult given current limitations on measurement precision, establishing this technique as a method to measure the mass radius relation of individual stars may provide a roadmap to a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature and composition of these stars. In the future, I intend to concentrate my efforts on further analysis of the data. I hope to be able to refine this technique and improve the precision of my measurement with the eventual goal of providing insight into the core composition of white dwarfs.</p>

<h3>How do we do it?</h3>
<p>In order to test the mass-radius relation, two independent measurements are needed to constrain the two physical unknowns. My project will constrain mass via a measurement of gravitational redshifts, a novel probe of the mass-radius relation.</p>

<p>Gravitational redshifts are a consequence of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/andp.19163540702">Einstein’s theory of general relativity</a>, which predicts that a photon originating from within a gravitational potential loses energy as it leaves that gravitational potential, manifesting itself as an apparent shift toward lower wavelengths (i.e. redder light), referred to as a redshift. White dwarfs, which are compact objects with very strong gravitational fields, undergo a strong and measurable gravitational redshift governed by Equation 1,
\(\begin{equation}
    v_g = \frac{\delta \lambda \cdot c}{\lambda} = \frac{GM}{Rc}
\end{equation}\)
where $G$ is Newton’s gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $M$ is the white dwarf’s mass, and $R$ is its radius. However, this gravitational redshift is difficult to measure due to the generally non-zero radial velocity of white dwarfs relative to Earth. This means that, although the gravitational redshift does cause the light we see from the star to be shifted in comparison to it’s original wavelength, there is an additional Doppler shift caused by the star’s movement toward or away from the Earth. The consequence of this is that it is extremely difficult to measure the gravitational redshift of a lone white dwarf, as the measurement is dominated by the object’s radial velocity, and the actual radial velocity that we, on Earth, observe, is equal to the sum of the object’s gravitational redshift and radial velocity, and there is no way to disentangle them.</p>

<p>I solve this problem by using a sample of white dwarfs that are gravitationally bound in wide binary orbits to a main sequence companion. Because main sequence stars are much less dense than white dwarfs, their gravitational redshift is negligible in comparison. Thus, the radial velocity that we observe is, to excellent approximation, just that: radial velocity free from signal. Since these main sequence companions are gravitationally bound to white dwarfs, their radial velocities ought to be be the same. Hence, their observed radial velocity is very nearly equal to their actual radial velocity, and gravitational redshift will be measured by comparing the two objects’ radial velocities.</p>

<p>The wide binaries will be identified using <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/506/2/2269/6131876">a catalog of one million wide binaries</a> identified from the European Space Agency’s Gaia satellite, from which the radial velocities of the main sequence companions will also be obtained. White dwarfs are much fainter stars, and so measuring their radial velocities to a good degree of accuracy is a challenging task. For the purposes of this project, I will use observations of the stars’ spectra taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and measure their radial velocities by comparing the theoretical positions of absorbtion lines of Hydrogen that resides in most white dwarfs’ atmosphere to their actual observed positions.</p>

<p>I will measure radius by directly fitting model atmospheres to photometry collected from white dwarfs by the SDSS. By comparing theoretical flux distributions to those observed from target stars, one can measure the radius of a white dwarf, thus providing the second constraint on the mass-radius relation necessary to probe the theoretical value.</p>

<p>Enceladus, Saturn’s second moon, orbits over 1 billion kilometers from the Sun. The average temperature of its icy surface temperature is just -198 degrees Celsius. Yet scientists believe that below its surface is an ocean of liquid water.</p>

<p>The Cassini mission relayed the first high-resolution image of Enceladus, reavealing a world with a bright, icy surface. In these pictures, scientists observed massive fractures running hundreds of kilometers along the moon’s surface. They called them “tiger stripes.” They immediately noticed something strange: the tiger stripes were warmer than the rest of the surface. Soon, telescope observations discovered that they contained massive geysers, shooting jets of water and ammonia into space at velocities of hundreds of kilometers an hour.</p>

<p>The tiger stripes were cryovolcanos, erupting plumes of liquid water like volcanoes on Earth erupt magma. These eruption materials settled on the surface, where they quickly froze onto Enceladus’ icy crust. But where was this water coming from, and how was it possible that it could be liquid so far from the Sun?</p>

<p>It was determined that there were two possibilities. Either the water could be stored in small isolated pockets scattered deep within the icy crust, or it could spring from a vast global ocean upon which the icy shell floated. To determine which of these was the case, Cassini was ordered to carry out detailed measurements of the moon’s gravitational field.</p>

<p>Solid ice and liquid water have different densities. This means that if the same size container is filled with both ice and water, each container will weigh different amounts despite being the same volume. Since more massive objects have stronger gravitational fields, by making detailed measurements of Enceladus’ gravitational field, scientists could determine the relative proportion of ice to water in the interior of the planet. Combining this with information about the wobble Enceladus experienced in its orbit around Saturn (the same type of wobble responsible for giving the Earth seasons), scientists found that Enceladus most likely contained a global subsurface ocean averaging over 20 kilometers thick.</p>

<p>But how is it possible that a moon orbiting millions of kilometers outside of the region warm enough for liquid water to exist on its surface could have such a vast ocean?</p>

<p>Most planets and moons are heated by three processes. First is primordial heat of formation. The very early solar system was dense and hot. As planetary embryos began to accrete mass and grow into planets, denser materials would have sunk to the core of the embryo and lighter materials would have risen to the top. As this occurred, energy previously stored in the gravitationally unfavorable state (with heavier materials at the surface and lighter materials at the center) would be converted to heat. Over time, this heat is radiated out of the body’s surface and into space. For a sufficiently large planet or moon, that heat could sustain liquid water for billions of years. In fact, this is one of the two dominant means by which the Earth is heated.</p>

<p>The other is radiogenic heating. Earth and many other bodies in the solar system are rich in elements such as uranium, potassium, and thorium. As these unstable isotopes decay, they emit radiation which heats their surroundings via the same mechanism used to generate heat in a nuclear reactor. In fact, the Cassini spacecraft itself used radiogenic heating to power its electronics. The bulk of the modern Earth’s heat is generated by the radioactive decay of uranium and potassium isotopes in its crust.</p>

<p>Neither one of these explanations were suitable for Enceladus though. Enceladus is small, only about the diameter of Arizona, and smaller bodies lose heat much faster than large bodies. This meant that Enceladus’ last joules of primordial heat were long ago radiated off into space. Radiogenic heating too was deemed to be an insufficient explanation. The quantities of unstable isotopes necessary to generate a subsurface ocean were too great to be compatible with estimates of the moon’s composition based on its gravitational field.</p>

<p>This left only one possible heat source: tidal heating. On Earth, tides are generated by the Moon’s gravitational pull. Because the Earth is a sphere, there is always a single point on the surface that’s closer to the Moon than any other point. This means that the Moon will exert a stronger gravitational pull on that point than any other point on the Earth’s surface. We experience high tides when that point or the point on Earth directly opposite it moves over us.</p>

<p>On Enceladus, strong tides are generated by Saturn and also by regular close encounters with Saturn’s next closest moon, Dione. These tides are far stronger than what we experience on Earth. They’re strong enough, in fact, to cause Enceladus to stretch to an elliptical shape. Ice sheets are pulled past each other and friction is created. This friction generates heat, which melts ice and keeps the subsurface ocean from freezing over. Enceladus is not the only moon that experiences tidal heating. Europa, a moon of Jupiter, is warmed by similar tidal interactions with its host gas giant. This allows it to support an ocean that contains more than twice as much water as all of Earth’s oceans combined.</p>

<p>It is universally accepted that Enceladus must have some liquid ocean. However, every model indicates that even accounting for tidal heating due to its interaction with Saturn and its moons, Enceladus should not generate enough heat to maintain the liquid ocean that all chemical and gravitational analyses indicate must be there. The moon is simply far hotter than it should be, and the exact mechanism by which heat is created remains a mystery. It’s possible that Cassini simply observed Enceladus during a period of unusually high volcanic activity, and its orbit changes over time to generate stronger tidal forces than those present now. Whatever the mechanism, understanding the process by which Enceladus is heated is an important problem for understanding the distribution of liquid water in the solar system, and possibly the distribution of life.</p>
